~/repos/crabbot has a TUI, it is a Websocket client that talks to the codex app-server websocket server.
~/repos/happy has a React native app for talking with codex(but not through Websocket).

All changes should be applied to both the Android and the Web. Android and the Web should have parity.

Your goal: port the crabbot TUI to our React Native app step by step.
